Strong Password Detection
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password
string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at
least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase charac-
ters, and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string against mul-
tiple regex patterns to validate its strength.
^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).{8,}$

At least one upper case English letter, (?=.*?[A-Z])
At least one lower case English letter, (?=.*?[a-z])
At least one digit, (?=.*?[0-9])
At least one special character, (?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-])
Minimum eight in length .{8,} (with the anchors)


Regex Version of strip()
Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the strip()
string method. If no other arguments are passed other than the string to
strip, then whitespace characters will be removed from the beginning and
end of the string. Otherwise, the characters specified in the second argu-
ment to the function will be removed from the string.
